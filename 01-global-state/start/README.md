This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the skeleton code for my global state blog! I hope you have fun and learn something cool :)

## How to Run

In order to get this to run, make sure you have an up-to-date version of node and npm

1. In your terminal, run `npm install`
2. Once the install is complete, run `npm run start`

It should be that easy! If it's not, then yell and scream and that should fix it.

## How to use this project

This is supposed to be a code-along project for my React Global State blog and video. Please go check either of those out. It would make my day! Make sure you like the content too so I can feel good about myself.
