This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the finished code from my React Global State code-along blog and video.

## How to Run

In order to get this to run, make sure you have an up-to-date version of node and npm

1. In your terminal, run `npm install`
2. Once the install is complete, run `npm run start`

It should be that easy! If it's not, then yell and scream and that should fix it.

## How to use this project

If you got stuck on the blog or the video, or just wanted a reference for implementing global state in your own projects, keep this code on hand!
